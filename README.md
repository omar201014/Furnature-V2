----
1. In this **Version** i rebuilt the project using the **Bootstrap** library and create a responsive design unlike the first version .
2. I also applied the media Quaries to some element to make the mobile view work more properly . 
3. with the help of **Javascript** i managed to handel the _click_ event applied to the content of _discover_ section so while in **mobile view** we can see the overlay cover with just a _click_ .
